# Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis

## Intro

**Customer segmentation** is the problem of uncovering information about a company's customer base, based on various customer attributes including their purchase behavior inferred from their transactions with the business. It segregates or aggregates customers into groups, where cutomers in the same group share some behavior and patterns. Customer segementation enables an organization to use the insights to (i) focus marketing effort precisely and efficiently (ii) offer new products to cater to certain recognized segments of customers (iii) untap new customer segments (iv) generate higher revenue.

**Market Basket Analysis** is a method to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing customers' shopping trend and identifying products that are likely to be purchased together. This insight enables merchants to **cross-sell**, i.e. sell related or complementary products to a customer, which eventually boosts sales.  


## Content

The project will explore techniques to implement those two concepts on a real world business transaction dataset and evaluate their effectiveness. The original project credits to Sarkar, D., Bali, R., Sharma, T.'s book *Practical Machine Learning with Python*.

### Data
The dataset contains transactions of a UK-based online retail store that sells gift items. The dataset is available from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).
